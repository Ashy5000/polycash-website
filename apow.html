                APoW, or Adjusted Proof of Work, is the consensus mechanism
                underlying the Polycash protocol. By combining
                <a href="#" class="link-info">difficulty adjustment</a>,
                <a href="#" class="link-info">time verification</a>, and the
                <a href="#" class="link-info">Polycash Incentives System</a>, APoW increases
                security, decentralization, and power efficiency to the network
                and blockchain. APoW is composed of three components. The first,
                difficulty adjustment, is necessary for decreasing the energy
                consumption of the network and improving its decentralization.
                Time verification, on the other hand, is designed to improve the
                network's security and reliability. Finally, the Polycash
                Incentives System prevents miners from performing Sybil attacks
                when attempting to maximise profits.<br /><br />

                <i>A graph of difficulty edge against mining speed.</i><br /><br />
                As shown in the above graph, faster miners have a higher chance of winning
                blocks. However, there are diminishing returns- past a certain point
                defined by the overhead costs of mining, it becomes unprofitable to
                inrease computing power. This means that large mining corporations
                that create centralization and draw extremely large amounts of power
                from the grid will not mine on the Polycash blockchain. Instead,
                miners will use equipment with low power usage and hashrate. This
                reduces environmental impact while also maintaining equity between
                miners.<br />
                And while the total hashrate of the network is lower, there is no
                harsh impact on security. APoW also works against entities trying
                to fork the chain by increasing their blocks' difficulty as their
                hashpower increases.<br />
                <b>More decentralization, less power, same security.</b>
