                The testnet is now live! Become a builder of Polycash's core
                ecosystem and get early access to a development blockchain that
                uses the exact same APoW protocol as the soon to be launched
                mainnet.
            </p>
            <h4 class="px-5">Getting Started</h4>
            <p class="px-5" style="width: 90%">
                First, you'll need to grab some (testnet)
                <a href="pcsh.html">PCSH</a>. As this is a testnet and not
                designed for deployment, it should come pretty cheap compared to
                other mainnet cryptocurrency tokens. Be aware that testnet PCSH
                won't transfer over to the mainnet when it's deployed. We
                suggest getting around 1 PCSH, which should pay for the
                deployment and development fees for a few medium-complexity
                dapps. Below are prices for basic actions on the blockchain.
                Please note that all instructions executed on the Polycash Virtual
                Machine are priced based on gas, not PCSH. Documentation on VM
                pricing is in another document.

               Next, you need to set up the Polycash software on your machine.
               The only client currently available is a Golang/Rust implementation
               of the Polycash protocol The only client currently available is the
               Golang/Rust reference implementation of the Polycash protocol. Visit
               <a href="https://github.com/ashy5000/cryptocurrency">
               https://github.com/ashy5000/cryptocurrency</a> and clone the repository.
               Navigate into the repository root and then into the <code>contracts</code>
               directory. Run <code>cargo build</code> and then move back into the repository
               root. Then run <code>go build -o builds/node/node_linux-amd64</code> to
               build the node executable. Run this executable to enter theBlockCMD console.
               Type <code>keygen</code> to generate a keypair, and then <code>showPublicKey</code>
               to get your public key. Copy the output. This is the address you'll need to
               send PCSH to. Once you've obtained some PCSH and sent it to the correct address,
               you can start writing your first smart contract.
               <br />
               Start by creating a file called <code>test.poly</code>. Write the
               following contents into the file:
               <br />
               <br />
               <code>
                   @memory::alloc(exitCode);<br />
                   @memory::set(exitCode, 2 + 2);<br />
                   @contract::exit(exitCode);
               </code>
               <br />
               <br />
               The above is a simple program written in the Polylang language to
               exit a smart contract with the exit code <code>2 + 2</code> (4).
               <br />
               Now, navigate into the project root of the reference client, and
               then into the <code>language</code> directory. Build the CMake
               project and run the executable with the path to <code>test.poly</code>
               as an argument. Then, navigate back one directory to the reference
               client's project root. Run the node executable. Once you are in the
               BlockCMD console, run the command <code>deploySmartContract
               language/out.blockasm</code>. This will deploy the smart contract
               you wrote to the testnet!
