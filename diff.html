            The Polycash blockchain calculates difficulty differently from other
            blockchains. Instead of a global difficulty that changes based on
            the network's hashrate, Polycash calculates a different difficulty
            for each miner that lowers the advantage of high hashrates.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>Advantages</h4>
            <h5>Low energy usage</h5>
            In Proof of Work blockchains, energy usage is a large issue. Because
            miners gain revenue directly proportional to their hash rate, they
            are incentivized to start very large mining operations, which use
            large amounts of energy. First of all, this high energy usage
            increases the barrier to entry for mining due to high energy costs.
            It also negatively impacts the environment and increases energy
            prices. But in Polycash, things are different. Miners don't need to
            use immense amounts of energy to be profitable; there is an optimum
            amount of computing power to gain the most profit. This lets new
            miners use less energy and resources to join and participate in the
            network, lowering energy usage of the blockchain by a huge amount.
            <h5>Decentralizaion</h5>
            In many other blockchains, centralization occurs when nodes combine
            their computing power into pools. When these pools control large
            portions of the network, its decentralization and security
            decreases, and it becomes more and more reliant on trust. For
            example, based on the last 6 months of data, only 2 mining pools,
            Foundry USA and AntPool, control over 50% of the hashrate in
            Bitcoin's network. In the Polycash blockchain, however, difficulty
            adjustment keeps these pools in check, ensuring that independent,
            smaller miners can have a share in the network's security.
